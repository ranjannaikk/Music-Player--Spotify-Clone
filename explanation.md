async function getSongs() {
    let a = await fetch("http://127.0.0.1:5500/songs/");
    let response = await a.text();
    console.log(response)

This code snippet demonstrates the use of the fetch function to make a request to a local server running at http://127.0.0.1:5500/songs/. The fetch function returns a promise that resolves to the Response object representing the response to the request.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

let a = await fetch("http://127.0.0.1:5500/songs/");
This line makes a GET request to the specified URL. The fetch function returns a promise that resolves to a Response object representing the response to the request. Using await here means that the execution of the code will pause until the promise is resolved.
let response = await a.text();
Once the promise returned by fetch is resolved, this line reads the response body as text. The text() method also returns a promise, so using await here ensures that the code waits for the promise to be resolved before continuing.
console.log(response);
Finally, this line logs the response body (in text format) to the console. The response body could be the content of the songs or any other data that the server has returned.
Overall, this code fetches the content from a local server endpoint and logs it to the console.


    let div = document.createElement("div")
    div.innerHTML = response;
    let as = div.getElementsByTagName("a")
    // console.log(as)


    let div = document.createElement("div"):
     This line creates a new div element in memory. This element is not yet part of the document's DOM (Document Object Model); it's just a JavaScript object representing a <div>.

div.innerHTML = response;:The innerHTML property of the div element is set to the value of the response variable. This essentially takes the string content of response, parses it as HTML, and sets it as the content of the div.

let as = div.getElementsByTagName("a"): This line retrieves all the <a> elements within the div element. The getElementsByTagName method returns a live HTMLCollection of elements with the given tag name (a in this case).

console.log(as): This logs the HTMLCollection (as) to the console. The HTMLCollection will contain all the <a> elements that were found within the div based on the HTML content of response.

Overall, this code is useful for extracting specific elements (in this case, <a> elements) from an HTML string (response) by creating a temporary div element, setting its innerHTML, and then querying for the desired elements within it.


    let songs = [];
    for (let index = 0; index < as.length; index++) {
        const element = as[index];
        if (element.href.endsWith(".mp3"))
        <!-- songs.push(element.href) -->
         songs.push(element.href.split("/songs/")[1])
        }

    return songs;

}



This JavaScript code is a loop that iterates over an array-like object as (presumably containing <a> elements) and filters out elements that represent MP3 files. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

let songs = [];: This initializes an empty array songs to store the URLs of MP3 files.
for (let index = 0; index < as.length; index++) {: This is a for loop that iterates over each element in the as array-like object. It uses index as the loop variable, starting from 0 and going up to as.length - 1.
const element = as[index];: Inside the loop, this line assigns the current element of as to the constant variable element. This allows easier access to the current <a> element being processed.
if (element.href.endsWith(".mp3")): This if statement checks if the href attribute of the current <a> element ends with the string ".mp3". The endsWith method returns true if the string ends with the specified suffix, otherwise false.
songs.push(element.href): If the href attribute ends with ".mp3", the URL (href) of the current <a> element is pushed into the songs array using the push method.
return songs;: After the loop finishes, the function returns the songs array, which contains the URLs of all the MP3 files found in the as array-like object.
Overall, this code filters out <a> elements representing MP3 files from the as array-like object and returns an array (songs) containing their URLs.

 songs.push(element.href.split("/songs/")[1])
This line of code is part of a loop that iterates over a collection of <a> elements, likely representing links to songs. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

element.href refers to the href attribute of the current <a> element in the loop. This attribute typically contains the URL the link points to.
split("/songs/") is a method called on the href attribute value. It splits the URL into an array of substrings, using "/songs/" as the separator. For example, if element.href is "http://example.com/songs/song1.mp3", this method call would result in ["http:", "example.com", "song1.mp3"].
[1] at the end of the split method call accesses the second element of the resulting array (index 1). This is because splitting the URL at "/songs/" would create an array where the part after "/songs/" is at index 1. In the example above, this would result in "song1.mp3".
songs.push(...) adds the extracted song name or ID (e.g., "song1.mp3") to the songs array. The push method adds one or more elements to the end of an array. Each iteration of the loop adds a new song to the array.
Overall, this line of code is extracting the song names or IDs from the URLs of <a> elements and adding them to an array (songs).

async function main(){
    //Get the list of all songs
    let songs= await getSongs()
    console.log(songs)
    // play the first song
    var audio = new Audio(songs[0]);
    audio.play();
    
}
main()  

This JavaScript code defines an async function main that fetches a list of songs using the getSongs function, logs the list of songs to the console, creates an Audio object for the first song in the list, and then plays that song. Finally, the main function is called to start the process.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

async function main() { ... }: This defines an asynchronous function named main.
let songs = await getSongs(): This line calls the getSongs function using await, which means the function will pause and wait for the getSongs function to complete and return a result. The result is assigned to the songs variable.
console.log(songs): This logs the songs array to the console, showing the list of songs fetched by the getSongs function.
var audio = new Audio(songs[0]): This creates a new Audio object using the URL of the first song in the songs array. The Audio object is used to play audio in the browser.
audio.play(): This plays the audio represented by the Audio object, which is the first song in the songs array.
main(): This calls the main function, starting the process of fetching songs and playing the first song.
In summary, this code fetches a list of songs, logs them to the console, and plays the first song in the list using the Audio object.



audio.addEventListener("loadeddata",()=>{
        let duration = audio.duration;
        console.log(duration)
    })


This JavaScript code adds an event listener to an audio element to listen for the "loadeddata" event, which is fired when the first frame of the audio has finished loading. When the event is triggered, the provided callback function is executed. Here's a breakdown of the code:

audio.addEventListener("loadeddata", () => { ... }): This line adds an event listener to the audio element. The event being listened for is "loadeddata", which is triggered when the first frame of the audio has finished loading. The second argument is an arrow function, which is the callback function that will be executed when the event is fired.
let duration = audio.duration;: Inside the callback function, this line retrieves the duration property of the audio element. The duration property represents the length of the audio track in seconds.
console.log(duration): Finally, the duration of the audio track is logged to the console. This will display the length of the audio track in seconds after the first frame has finished loading.

console.log(audio.duration, audio.currentSrc, audio.currentTime): This logs the duration of the audio, the current source URL of the audio, and the current playback position (in seconds) of the audio to the console.

Overall, this code snippet allows you to perform actions (in this case, logging the duration of the audio track) once the audio has loaded enough data to determine its duration.





let songUL=document.querySelector(".songlist").getElementsByTagName("ul")[0]
    for (const song of songs) {
        songUL.innerHTML=songUL.innerHTML + `<li>${song.replaceAll("%20"," ")}</li>`;
    }

This JavaScript code aims to append a list of songs to an existing <ul> element in a document. Here's a breakdown of the code:

let songUL=document.querySelector(".songlist").getElementsByTagName("ul")[0]: This line selects the first <ul> element inside an element with the class "songlist". querySelector(".songlist") selects the element with the class "songlist", and getElementsByTagName("ul")[0] selects the first <ul> element within that element. If there are no <ul> elements or no element with the class "songlist", songUL will be undefined.
for (const song of songs) { ... }: This is a loop that iterates over each song in the songs array. It seems that songs is an array of song titles or song URLs.


songUL.innerHTML=songUL.innerHTML + <li>${song}</li>;: Inside the loop, this line appends each song to the innerHTML of the songUL element by creating a new <li> (list item) element for each song using a template literal. The ${song} part is used to insert the value of song into the template literal, creating a new list item for each song.

${song.replaceAll("%20"," ")} replaces all occurrences of %20 in the song string with a space. %20 is a URL-encoded character for a space.

This new <li> element contains the current song name, formatted as a list item.
Overall, this code appends each song in the songs array as a new list item to the <ul> element with the class "songlist".
